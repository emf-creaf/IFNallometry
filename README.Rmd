The goal of IFNallometry is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of IFNallometry from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("emf-creaf/IFNallometry")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(IFNallometry)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
